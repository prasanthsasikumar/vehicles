# Swainston Garage

Swainston was more than just a garage—it was a home, a workshop, and a gathering place for friends from around the world. This is where we fixed and built many of our vehicles, turning wrenches and sharing dreams under one roof.

## The Peak

At our peak, we had **14 cars** parked outside the house. The driveway was a testament to our collective passion for automobiles, each vehicle with its own story, its own character, and its own set of challenges that brought us together.

## A Global Family

We came from all corners of the world:
- **India**
- **Iran**  
- **Japan**

Despite our different backgrounds, we were united by our love for cars and the bonds we formed working side by side in the garage.

## The PhD Years

Most of us were doing our PhDs at the time. The garage became our escape, our therapy, and our creative outlet. Between research papers and late-night study sessions, we found solace in the mechanical simplicity of fixing cars and the camaraderie of working together.

## Where We Are Now

We left together, but life took us to different corners of the world:
- **Singapore**
- **USA**
- **Japan**
- **New Zealand**

Though we're scattered across continents, Swainston will always have a special place in our hearts. It was where we learned, grew, and created memories that transcend distance and time.

## A Place of Fun and Friendship

This place was filled with laughter, late-night conversations, the smell of motor oil, and the satisfaction of a job well done. It was where friendships were forged over shared challenges and victories, both big and small.

Swainston wasn't just a garage—it was home.
