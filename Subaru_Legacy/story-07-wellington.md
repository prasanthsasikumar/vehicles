# Life in Wellington

Later in 2018, I had to move to Wellington for work. I was working with the Te Papa Museum (national museum of NZ) and it was a contract job and as soon as it finished I was out of income. I tried applying for a few jobs, but that didn't go anywhere and as I needed to have money, I was working multiple jobs and one of that was at PlaceMakers. It was enough to pay off my debts. But before I got that gig, there was a time when I had no money and was struggling a lot - even at the peak of starvation, I did not sell the car. I was hoping that this would pass and I would be able to keep the car. This is when it got the BBS wheels that I always wanted. Changes made are every once in a while when I can afford it.

## Stashing the Car Back in Christchurch

During my time in Wellington, I got an offer to do a PhD with the father of Virtual Reality - Mark Billinghurst. It was an opportunity of a lifetime and I took it! I was so broke and couldn't afford to have a car in Auckland. So my friend said I could park the car at their place in Christchurch while I sort out things. Which is what I did. I drove down the car to Christchurch and kept it there. I flew to Auckland, life got busy and the Legacy stayed in the South Island for about a year with me visiting once to just start the car and move it around. There was another break-in attempt at this time as well, but they only took the boost gauge when they broke in. No other damages.
