# Keeping the Car in Storage

As my PhD was concluding, I decided that I would move out of NZ and go and see the world. I sold every single thing I owned - remember I had engine cranes, stands, multiple copies of most tools, compressors, spare engines etc. The only thing I chose to keep is the Legacy. I found a place out in Hamilton which is about an hour away from Auckland. I cleaned up the car and with lots of sadness took it to Mohsen's house and we loaded up the car in the truck and drove it to where it sits now. Saying goodbye is always very hard - especially when you don't know about the future and how long until you meet again. This is where the car sits as of now. There was a bit of underbody rust starting to develop and I hope it doesn't go very bad. All I can hope is that I make enough money so that I can ship it to the country I'm in and restore it to the former glory and once again be my daily.

## What is in for the Future?

Future plans are always a mystery. What I would love is to be able to move to the US someday and have my company based there and get the car imported and registered under the vintage cars rule. It will qualify for this in 2026 as the car is a 2001 model year. Plans of upgradation would be full strip, sandblast and repaint (either the same color or grey). Get a Rev C body kit, build up the engine, keep the twin-turbo setup and make around 450hp reliably. What I really liked to begin with is the twin-turbo setup with its "valley of death" (when the turbos are switching). I want to keep all those characters as it is.
