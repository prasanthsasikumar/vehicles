# Trip with Parents

My family visited me in Christchurch and we had an epic trip. This was one of the many, but being able to do that with family and give them experiences that was so different was a big deal. We went from Christchurch to Queenstown through the beautiful Taupo Lake, stayed in Arrowtown and Queenstown, and went to Milford Sound. On the way back we came through Dunedin. During the many months it was a family car, a camper, beach car, fishing vehicle, tow, roadside assist for buddies. The car took up so many roles as it was the main player.
