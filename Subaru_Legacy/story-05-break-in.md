# The Break-In Incident

Subaru Legacy is one of the most stolen vehicles in NZ. Because it is unassuming, has enough power to get away from police and most importantly is super easy to steal. I knew the danger when I got one, but didn't think it would happen until it happens to you. Some thieves have been looking out for the car for a while, they studied my usual patterns of working at the lab. I go home in the evening for dinner and then come and work late nights during the winter months.

One day - I came in at my usual time, but I wasn't feeling well, so about 10 mins into coming to the lab, I decided to go back home. I went to the car park and there were some components lying next to the car and the car door was unlocked. I was wondering what is going on and then when I entered the car, I could see that the ignition barrel is fully smashed and a lot of wires have been cut. The car had an alarm system which was highly rated but somehow they were able to break in. What probably saved the car from being stolen is that there is a safety switch under the clutch which is only triggered on very hard press of the clutch. They might have missed this and tried rewiring a lot of things. I called my friends in the lab, and we towed the disabled car to my house. In the coming days, I went to Pick-A-Part to get parts for the car and found how to take out the ignition barrel from a car (chiseling away on the safety screw is a lot of hard work). Then rewired the wiring that was damaged and got the car running.
