# Moving to Auckland

Right after Covid, I was able to finally move the car from Christchurch to Auckland. By this time there were about 11 cars at our place at any given time and the neighbours were wondering what our real jobs are. I was using the car as the daily driver, we had many good memories, lots of late-night drives, going to car meetups and generally just enjoying life. First time able to afford Pirelli tyres - used ones. Now as the car was being used regularly, and I did not have the means to keep up the maintenance that the car needed, occasionally I would skip on service. There was some sound coming from the gearbox in certain times and I could feel the binding at times. Did not do the inspection as the saying goes, "why fix something that is not broken". This would lead to one of my greatest stories yet.
