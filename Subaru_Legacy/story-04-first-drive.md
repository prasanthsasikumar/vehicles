# First Drive & Adventures

## First Drive

Anyway, the car was done and I remember the first time I keyed in the ignition. I had to disable the fuel pump so that I could prime the engine and then when I connected the pump, it fired up right away and that drive to the fuel station was spectacular. I have never driven something that has so much power and character and I loved it so much. I couldn't believe that all those things I did in fact did work!

The next day I decided to take the car out for a drive - at night. I did not drive the car before because it did not have a Warrant of Fitness and registration. I took it for a drive at night so that cops wouldn't be around as much. On an empty patch, I floored the car and felt how the turbos spooled up and I was going 180 fairly quickly. Never in my life have I gone that fast - I was super happy and grinning ear to ear on that drive back home. All the moments laid the foundation for the next projects to come.

Later on I got the windshield replaced and it passed a warrant after some other minor fixes. The car was part of many adventures, I took it to most places in South Island, installed boost gauges and different blow-off valves to get that "stuu tuuu" sounds. Exhaust was replaced. I started buying many of the same cars later on in the coming months when I finally had some money and I would swap out the interesting bits I find on those to here.
