# The Search & Purchase

## Throwback

From the beginning of looking at cars (even before moving to NZ), I was looking into cars and engines as I knew nothing about them. I was particularly interested in the Nissan Z series and cars with twin turbo. I was very fascinated with the turbo setup - even more so with the twin-turbo setup. I really wanted to have a Subaru Legacy Twin Turbo (Rev C) version (the last version with twin turbo). I knew nothing about cars and also had no money to buy a good Legacy. I kept talking to people, joining Subaru forums and searching relentlessly for one that would come cheap - about 2k NZD.

Meanwhile, I participated in a hackathon-like event where I got $1000 as prize money. I kept it towards buying the car. One day while searching TradeMe, I found an ad listed for a car at 2700 NZD. I called that person up - a very cool British lady - and negotiated the price to 2500 NZD. This was very cheap for the car considering it did not have any issues (it did not run because it had no battery). Because it was cheap, I decided to buy it and then went to the place to collect the car. All it needed was a battery and I should have gone with one. Instead, because the car hasn't been run in a long time, everything was seized up. Also, jump-starting didn't work. I should have actually gone with a good battery. But I again knew nothing about batteries or what kind of battery size/power is needed.

So I asked my good friend and flatmate Han to come and help fetch this car. He did not have a NZ license and was not comfortable driving on the left side of the road (he is from China) but I told him it's just a few kms and we will not take the highway. So I took my little Integra and bought a tow cable from Warehouse and went to collect the car. The car was not turning on, so we decided to tow the car. And because it was showing much less time to go through the highway than through the small roads, I took the highway without telling Han. Poor guy had no choice as he was driving in the Legacy behind (which had no power - which means no power brakes or power steering). I can only imagine how hard it was for him to manage this. We were already friends but became brothers after this and we got him a car shortly after.

Anyway, halfway we went to a SuperCheap Auto and bought a new battery for the car. Then fiddling around the car for a while, it finally started and the gearbox was stuck for a while. Reverse gear came to life first and then rest of the gears followed. That drive back home from SuperCheap Auto I could experience the turbos coming to life and that got me hooked! The car needed so much love and care. The windscreen had a crack, the timing belt needed to be changed, all fluids needed change, tyres weren't that great. Music system did not work etc.

I did not have a garage but my good friend Amit did and he didn't have a car. Perfect. I moved the car to his place and the restoration journey began.
