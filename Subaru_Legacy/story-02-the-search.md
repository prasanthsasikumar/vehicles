# The Search & Purchase

## Throwback

Curiosity about cars and engines started early (even before moving to NZ), despite having almost no hands-on knowledge. The initial obsession was the Nissan Z series and turbo setups—especially twin-turbo layouts. That eventually narrowed into a very specific target: the Subaru Legacy Twin Turbo Rev C (the last revision to run the twin-turbo configuration).

Budget was the limiting factor. The goal became finding a usable Legacy for around 2k NZD—meaning lots of conversations, time on Subaru forums, and relentless searching for anything priced low enough to be realistic.

A small break came through a hackathon-style event, which brought in $1000 in prize money and made the purchase feel possible. Not long after, a TradeMe listing appeared at 2700 NZD. A call to the seller—a very cool British lady—ended with a negotiated price of 2500 NZD. It was cheap for what it was, and the car didn’t seem to have major issues; it simply wasn’t running because there was no battery.

Pickup day delivered the first lesson: “just needs a battery” can still turn into an ordeal. With the car sitting for a long time, things felt seized up, and a jump-start didn’t get it going. The right battery (and knowing what to buy) would have helped, but battery specs and sizing were still a mystery at the time.

Help came from a good friend and flatmate, Han. He didn’t have a NZ licence and wasn’t comfortable driving on the left (he’s from China), but the plan was a short tow on back roads. The Integra was used as the tow car, a tow cable was picked up from The Warehouse, and the Legacy was collected—still not starting—so towing was the only option.

The route choice was… less than ideal. The highway was faster, so that’s where the tow ended up. Han had to manage the Legacy behind with no engine running—which meant no power steering and no power brakes. It was brutal, and it turned an already-solid friendship into something closer to brotherhood. A car for Han followed not long after.

Halfway home, a stop at SuperCheap Auto fixed the immediate problem: a new battery. After some fiddling, the engine finally started. The gearbox took a moment to free up—reverse came back first, then the rest of the gears. From SuperCheap back home, the turbos started to spool, and that was the hook.

The car clearly needed love: a cracked windscreen, a timing belt due, fluids overdue, tired tyres, and a dead stereo. Without a garage, progress would have been slow—until Amit stepped in. He had a garage and no car, which made it a perfect setup. The Legacy moved to his place, and the restoration journey began.
