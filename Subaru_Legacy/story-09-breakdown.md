# Epic Breakdown

I finished my PYR - which is one of the milestones in PhD in NZ, where you present your work and a committee has to approve it for you to continue with your PhD. As this was done, just like my usual self I decided that I need to go on holiday to celebrate this. It was supposed to be a short trip - one day at the beach, then to my fav spot in NZ for camping (Rotorua place), there to Tauranga and back. It went well until Rotorua, I was babying the car whenever I felt the binding. On retrospection, it could have been the front differential that was out of fluid.

On my way to Tauranga from Rotorua, I chose the log trucking route instead of the normal route (because I saw a camper van with the slogan "chose the scenic route, especially when lost" or something like that). That was a nice drive until I forgot that I need to baby the car instead of driving fast. There was a low area in a curve where the differential gave up with a loud burst and we lost all power to move. I pulled the car to the side and I couldn't do anything other than open the hood and put the hazards. Log trucks that were coming behind me in my lane had very little time to react and they were narrowly missing the car (they cannot stop as they are heavy vehicles).

As I was stuck, a group of Maori who did not even speak a word of English were passing by on the other lane and took a u-turn and came for help. As soon as they came, I took out my tow rope and attached it to their vehicle which was an SUV. They understood the assignment and towed me to the top region where there was a shoulder on the road to park in safety. They were very kind and though we could not communicate much, they gave the most help I needed. Now I can find a way to get help. They said their goodbyes and left.

There was no signal in this region, so I had to climb the nearby mountain to get the signal range and then called Reza to get help. I WhatsApped him my GPS coordinates and asked him to pass this on to Mohsen who is our tow truck guy. Later I climbed the mountain again and called Reza and he said the message has been passed on and Mohsen will come. The whole incident happened around 11 am in the morning, and I had food and water in the car. Mohsen needs 5 hours to come to me and I waited as I had my books and food. During this time, many people came asking if I needed anything - food, water or lift to the nearest town. Even cops came and relayed the message to their own so that they know I'm stranded here. Mohsen arrived around 8 pm in the evening and we loaded up the car into the truck and started our journey back to Auckland. This is a man who drove 10 hours so that I can be home - and he didn't even accept any money (don't worry I paid him later). The amount of kindness is unbelievable in people. This is a something that I kept finding over and over in many many instances in NZ. Mohsen is an absolute legend.
