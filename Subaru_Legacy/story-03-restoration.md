# The Restoration

This was the biggest project I have undertaken to that day. I have only one oil change experience under my belt. I knew nothing else. I printed out all the car manuals that I could find on Legacy which were in English and some I translated into English from Japanese. The following two weeks, I did nothing but read and watch YouTube videos. If there was something to be known about maintaining a second-gen Legacy, chances are I read it.

On realizing that the cam belt service is long overdue, I planned out the way to do all of that by myself. I knew this was going to be tough, but I had made up my mind. I bought all the required components and used every last penny I had - I didn't know how I will eat the next week, but I had the car parts. I started slowly, removing screws and labeling them meticulously. I torqued anything that needed and tested it 3 times to make sure it was the right torque setting.

## Acts of Kindness

In this process, there was an incident that had a huge impact on my life. I grew up in India, people were nice but I was never used to strangers being super kind like how people are in NZ. There was a point in putting the cam belt on, I needed to secure the camshafts in place. But a special tool that Subaru makes was needed. This tool was very expensive and I could not afford it. I was stuck. Searching and posting online did not help - all of them said I need the tool. So I decided to go to a workshop and ask to borrow the tool and pay a price for renting or asking for help.

I went to "Stubaru", a Subaru specialist in Christchurch. He and his wife run the shop. His wife came out and he later patiently explained to me that I don't actually need this tool, but I can get one for $100 from a shop nearby that will do the trick. He even gave a note for me. I went with that to the shop, got the tool, came back and that did work! This act of kindness to someone that they didn't know had a huge impact on my life. I try to be that person whenever someone comes to me for help. Stu from Stubaru doesn't know this, but he made a huge impact on my life. Incidents like this have happened many times since in NZ and having travelled decently well I can say that the most kindest people live down under in Aotearoa.
