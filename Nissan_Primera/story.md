# Nissan Primera (2018)

At this point I have made money on one car (the Integra) and got a couple of cars for my friends for cheap. So I decided that it would be great to find a cheap car and fix it up and sell it. So I bought this from the Turners auction for end-of-life cars.

Only when I got the car I realized that there are more issues that I need to sort out than expected. With Integra and the Legacy I realized that I can buy cheap media players for the car and that would massively increase the value of the car. This is because these new media decks have been sold in Chinese websites like Alibaba for very cheap as they mass produce it - earlier technology made it very expensive to have the functionalities and with the popularity of Bluetooth, everyone likes a car with Bluetooth audio. And these markets would only present itself for a short period before it becomes too easy and every old car would be retrofitted and new cars anyway will have it.

I fixed the rust patches in the front - learning how to do body work in the process. I made all the necessary changes and was about to take the car for inspection for Warrant of Fitness. I was cleaning the car by removing the wiper blades and my hand accidentally slipped and hit the windshield. It broke and if I replaced the glass professionally it would mean no profit for me. So I decided to do it myself. Found replacement glass at Pick-A-Part. Took it out myself and learned how to install glass. Every car taught something new.

Later on I sold the car for a profit but it took more time to sell because of the delay.
