# Subaru Legacy Parts(Silver - Parts Car)

It was the same as mine, but in station wagon form. It had great exhaust, lots of goodies like boost gauge etc. and good panels. The cam belt broke on this one and the owner just wanted to get rid of it.

This is where I learned about the need for impact tools because traditional screwdrivers and spanners cannot unlock very tight bolts (like the seatbelt ones).

**Result**: Sold some of the parts as parts and scrapped the rest.
