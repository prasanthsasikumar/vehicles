# Subaru Legacy (Blue - "Dog Car")

This came up in TradeMe for $1000 and the guy was happy to give it for $550.

Got the car, it was full of dog fur. The issue with the car is that it was overheating and on the inspection I could not see much trouble. So stress stressed the car by going on hill climbs and sure enough it overheated. But I had water to be used for coolant with me.

Identified the coolant leak to the top of the radiator. Replaced the radiator with a good used one and everything was great.

**Result**: Sold the car - easy bucks.
