# Honda CRV

We got this car because it was a steal. We got it for $350 NZD - with fog lamps, sunroof and lots of other accessories.

**Only issue**: Blown headgasket.

We knew the issue - so decided to use the car until it dies because it was so cheap. It did not die, we used it for a couple of years and went through multiple Warrant of Fitness without an issue until we pushed it enough to the point where the car would overheat in about 30 minutes.

So I decided to remove the head, resurface it and install new headgaskets. It was too ambitious for my experience. Though I did everything right, the new headgasket blew right after. Since all that effort went into the drain, we sold the car for scrap. It was a really nice car with lots of good memories.
