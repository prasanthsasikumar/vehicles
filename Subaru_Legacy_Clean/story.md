# Subaru Legacy (Clean)

Very rare Legacy with low kms which was recently imported from Japan. It was great interior, pristine paint and very healthy engine.

The only drawback was that the car was deregistered. I learned the process of re-registering a car with this and sold this car.

**Result**: Made a huge profit on this one.
