## First Car - Made Me Realize That Cars Can Actually Make Money

As I was recovering from ACL replacement, it was quite hard to commute with my bicycle or walking. One day I was walking with 10 kg of rice from an Indian store and it was very hard. This was the first month of landing in NZ. So I looked at the TradeMe website and got a beater car for 650 NZD. Even in the worst-case scenario, I would be able to use it for a few months.

It was freedom all over again. Reliable car. Once I accidentally got locked out of the car with keys in the ignition. It was at the HIT Lab NZ parking where I was doing my masters. Called AA only to realize that they would need $300 for a simple car unlock. I said I will call back and then Googled "how to break into the car". Because this car had a frameless design, it was relatively easy to get into the lock handle. I got all the necessary tools like the scale etc. from the lab. That was the first DIY. Ironically, this is the same parking lot where my Legacy was broken into a couple of months later.

I was driving around and was looking at options to buy. From the beginning of looking at cars (even before moving to NZ), I was looking into cars and engines as I knew nothing about them. I was particularly interested in the Nissan Z series and cars with twin turbo. I was very fascinated with the turbo setup - even more so with the twin-turbo setup. I really wanted to have a Subaru Legacy Twin Turbo (Rev C) version (the last version with twin turbo).

One fine Sunday I went to collect the second-hand oil change things needed and got a very cheap toolbox for $15 from Warehouse NZ, a place where you can buy a lot of necessary items in NZ.

I serviced the Integra by myself. Without even knowing how to jack up a car properly, jack points etc. Thinking back, it was super dumb, but it was cool that I got started somewhere.

The car had a good run - I learned about WOF (Warrant of Fitness), and all the other procedures. Could drive with Indian license for a year so I did that. I didn't buy the car for profit - but when I was selling the car, I was able to make some money, about $200 in profit. This got me hooked, little did I know that this was the beginning of a new chapter in my life.
